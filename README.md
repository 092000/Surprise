author: Nicolas Hug

Overview
--------

RecSys is an open source Python package that provides with tools to build and
evaluate the performance of many recommender system prediction algorithms. Its
goal is to make life easy(-ier) for reseachers and students who want to play
around with new recommender algorithm ideas.

A strong emphasis is laid on
[documentation](http://recsys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which we
have tried to make as clear and precise as possible by pointing out every
details of the algorithms, in order for the practitioner to have perfect
control over his experiments.
