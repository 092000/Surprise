Welcome to PyRec's documentation!
=================================

PyRec is an open source Python package that provides with tools to build and
evaluate the performance of many recommender system prediction algorithms. Its
goal is to make life easy(-ier) for reseachers and students who want to play
around with new recommender algorithm ideas.

A strong emphasis is laid on documentation, which we have tried to make as
clear and precise as possible by pointing out every details of the algorithms,
in order for the practitioner to have perfect control over his experiments.
