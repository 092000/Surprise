    """The famous *SVD* algorithm, as popularized by `Simon Funk
    <http://sifter.org/~simon/journal/20061211.html>`_ during the Netflix
    Prize.

    The prediction :math:`\\hat{r}_{ui}` is set as:

    .. math::
        \hat{r}_{ui} = \mu + b_u + b_i + q_i^Tp_u

    If user :math:`u` is unknown, then the bias :math:`b_u` and the factors
    :math:`p_u` are assumed to be zero. The same applies for item :math:`i`
    with :math:`b_u` and :math:`q_i`.

    For details, see eq. 5 from `Matrix Factorization Techniques For
    Recommender Systems
    <http://www.columbia.edu/~jwp2128/Teaching/W4721/papers/ieeecomputer.pdf>`_
    by Koren, Bell and Volinsky. See also *The Recommender System Handbook*,
    section 5.3.1.

    To estimate all the unkown, we minimize the following regularized squared
    error:

    .. math::
        \sum_{r_{ui} \in R_{train}} \left(r_{ui} - \hat{r}_{ui} \\right)^2 +
        \lambda\\left(b_i^2 + b_u^2 + ||q_i||^2 + ||p_u||^2\\right)


    The minimization is performed by a very straightforward stochastic gradient
    descent:

    .. math::
        b_u &\\rightarrow b_u &+ \gamma (e_{ui} - \lambda b_u)\\\\
        b_i &\\rightarrow b_i &+ \gamma (e_{ui} - \lambda b_i)\\\\
        p_u &\\rightarrow p_u &+ \gamma (e_{ui} q_i - \lambda p_u)\\\\
        q_i &\\rightarrow q_i &+ \gamma (e_{ui} p_u - \lambda q_i)

    where :math:`e_{ui} = r_{ui} - \\hat{r}_{ui}`. These steps are performed
    over all the ratings of the trainset and repeated ``n_epochs`` times.
    Baselines are initialized to ``0``. User and item factors are initialized
    to ``0.1``, as recommended by `Funk
    <http://sifter.org/~simon/journal/20061211.html>`_.

    You have control over the learning rate :math:`\gamma` and the
    regularization term :math:`\lambda`. Both can be different for each
    kind of parameter (see below). By default, learning rates are set to
    ``0.005`` and regularization termes are set to ``0.02``.

        n_factors: The number of factors. Default is ``100``.
        n_epochs: The number of iteration of the SGD procedure. Default is
            ``20``.

            ``0.02``.

            ``lr_all`` if set. Default is ``None``.
